# BOOTCHAMP  

###### THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF JR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

BOOTCHAMP is a forum for jr software developers to share projects, inspirational stories, cautionary tales, and candid advice. Though BOOTCHAMP reflects UX norms established by social media it takes more after blogs and forums. It took a three week sprint to establish scope, devise must-have user stories, and deliver the MVP.  
  
Said MVP is a web application where users can share experiences starting out in software development by way of putting posts to a forum. A user can view a list of posts on the home page, and can click on each post to view more detail. Signed in users can create, edit and delete posts. Signed in users can comment on posts, and edit and delete those comments. Each registered user gets a profile which they can update, but not delete. 

There are stories in the project backlog ready to go for a second sprint.
